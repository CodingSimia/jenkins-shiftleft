    Shift Left by Upwind brings robust security scanning directly into your Jenkins pipeline.
    Designed to help teams "shift left" on security, this plugin identifies package vulnerabilities
    early in the development process. Add Shift Left as a build step to prevent security risks before
    they reach production, ensuring a safer, more resilient codebase.
